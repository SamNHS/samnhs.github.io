Welcome to my site. I am a full stack developer, working in an agile manner, with 2 decades of experience developing web applications and supporting the infrastructure they are hosted on.

The systems I have developed during my career include systems used for project management, risk management, incident management, GP / NHS Intranets, eProcurement, community engagement (membership registration, email notifications) and course planning/booking for trainers and their trainees.  

My primary platform is .NET Core and the Microsoft development stack, but I also work with PHP and associated frameworks, frontend and backend.  

More information on the technologies can be found on the [About](about.md) page.
