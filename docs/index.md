Welcome to my site. I am a full stack developer, working in an agile manner, with 2 decades of experience developing web applications and supporting the infrastructure they are hosted on (Windows and Linux).

The systems I have developed during my career include the following kinds of systems:

- Care Home Occupancy
- Community Engagement Portal (Email Newsletters, Membership)
- Concerns and Complaints
- Course Booking
- Desktop Notifications
- GP Enhanced Services Invoicing
- Incident Management
- Project Management
- Referrals
- Risk Management
- SMS alerts for major incidents

My primary platform is .NET Core and the Microsoft development stack, but I also work with PHP and associated frameworks, frontend and backend.  

More information on the technologies I use and am looking at learning can be found on the [About](about.md) page.
