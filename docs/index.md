## Welcome

I work as a senior application developer for the National Health Service in the UK as part of North East Lincolnshire CCG.
My role involves development of web applications, primarily in .NET and .NET Core, but also in Symfony and Laravel.
I also manage Windows servers via Plesk (and RDP) and Linux via cPanel WHM.
